# Reference Functions

Some of the functions provided by Sass Fairy return a reference to a function so they may be used as parameters in other function calls. Examples of this are the compare methods from [`@sass-fairy/list`](../api/list/overview.mdx).

```scss
$sorted: list.sort($unsorted, list.compare-numeric())
```

However, these methods will function normally when provided with parameters. This allows other libraries to use these functions directly.

```scss
$first-item: 5
$second-item: 3
$result: list.compare-numeric($first-item, $second-item)
```

## Implementing in Custom Modules

Creating these functions in you own modules is very easy using the [`meta.call-or-reference()`](../api/meta/call-or-reference.mdx) from the [`@sass-fairy/meta`](../api/meta/overview.mdx) package. [Read the API](../api/meta/call-or-reference.mdx) for more details.
