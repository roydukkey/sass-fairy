# Install

In order to begin using any Sass Fairy module, its package must first be installed and your Sass compiler must be configured to include it.

This example shows how to install the list module.

```sh
npm install @sass-fairy/list
```

After the package has been installed, it might already be available for use just like any other Sass module.

```scss
@use '@sass-fairy/list';
```

However, if Sass can't find the module, your compiler will need to be configured to include the `node_modules` folder. That should look something like this:

```js
const sass = require('sass');

sass.compile(filePath, {
  loadPaths: ['node_modules']
});
```
